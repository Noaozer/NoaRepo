Folders is a new feature that allows users to create folders which are shown in the repo page, In order to organize docs in Swimm.

The development of the folders feature involves behavior changes, UI/UX changes that should pass quality assurance tests.

**Preconditions**

*   Setting up a testing environment after development is complete

*   Comprehensive testing plan (STP,STD)

**Testing Environment**

*   Regression - 2nd QA round
1.  After QA testing session and the bug fixes an additional session will be conducted that will include regression testing in order to make sure that fixing a bug did not create a new bug

2.  The tests will be written later according to the results of the first round

    <br/>
*   Automated
1.  **Saar -** Do you plan to write automated tests? Saw you have E2E ticket

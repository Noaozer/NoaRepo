Test Plan:

# section 1 - write&read SWmd

1) create a doc with editor commands **Markdown Syntax**\-

1.  Gapcursor (It's default but we need to make sure it works properly and not forgotten).

2.  **History (what do you mean?)**

3.  Slash commands (WIP [https://tiptap.dev/experiments/commands](https://tiptap.dev/experiments/commands), we can base ourselves on it instead)

4.  **Floating menu (TODO) (the editor menu?)**

5.  Bubble menu (TODO) (AKA Context actions in the current editor)

6.  **Keyboard shortcuts popover? (TODO) (do you mean command c/v/z... ?)**

7.  Custom Paste (Markdown, Plaintext)

8.  Focus (Adds a class to the focused element for custom styling or logic)

9.  **prosemirror-codemark (Third party) (what?)**

10.  AI stuff

2) commit the doc

3) go through SWmd:

*   compare the SWmd to the doc - make sure every syntax in SWmd represents command in the doc

*   male sure the file is written in mark down syntax

4) open the file - make sure Swimm read the file and shows every command right

<br/>

1) create a doc with editor commands **Swimm Syntax**\-

1.  (Code) Snippet

2.  (Smart) Token

3.  Doc/Playlist links (AKA Swimm links, just links to another doc).

4.  Mention

5.  Text/Snippet Template

2) commit the doc

3) go through SWmd:

*   compare the SWmd to the doc - make sure every syntax in SWmd represents command in the doc

*   make sure the file is written in Swimm new syntax

4) open the file - make sure Swimm read the file and shows every command right

<br/>

<br/>

1) create a doc with editor commands (Swimm + mark down syntax)

2) try to break the syntax

3) commit changes

4) make sure the doc present all the commands (without break)

5) go through SWmd:

*   compare the SWmd to the doc - make sure every syntax in SWmd represents command in the doc

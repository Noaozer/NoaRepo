2.  Order in **"Auto syncable"** - by objects (token, snippets, path....) if the object has other mention in the doc they will be nested according to their location in the doc.

3.  Order in **"Outdated"** - by objects (token, snippets, path....) if the object has other mention in the doc they will be nested according to their location in the doc.

4.  **Clickable items** - Each item in the panel is clickable. clicking on an item will **scroll** and focus the document on the corresponding outdated code reference

5.  **The heading in nested item -** is leading to the first instance that - which is located first in the doc

6.  **Clickable items nested -** Each item in both "Autosyncable" and "Out of date" sections can represent a group of multiple instances

section - CTA - to accept or remove review items + animation - edit mode

    *   allowing for a single undo action.

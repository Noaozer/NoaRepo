1.  when dropping the snippet the focus of the page stays on the old position of the snippet instead of his new one

2.  scrolling up the editor options scrolls too (video in photos)

3.  **question:** if show more is open when drag and drop the snippet it should be added in the expend?

4.  dragging the snippet above expended + show more snippet close the show more part after dropping but dragging the snippet under keep the show more part expended (video in photos)

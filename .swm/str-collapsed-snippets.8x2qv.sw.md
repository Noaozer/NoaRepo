1.  when dropping the snippet the focus of the page stays on the old position of the snippet instead of his new one V

2.  scrolling up the editor options scrolls too (video in photos) V

3.  **question:** if show more is open when drag and drop the snippet it should be added in the expend? V

4.  dragging the snippet above expended + show more snippet close the show more part after dropping but dragging the snippet under keep the show more part expended (video in photos) V

# STR - üìù Onboarding improvements

Ok I checked the onboarding-

1.  in the interactive screens (not including - Learn Swimm in 1 min) there is a black frame on the right side and at the bottom of the frame, it can be remove? to make it look like figma V

2.  The **Next** button is blocked for clicking until the buttons in the interactive screens shows up (add a live snippet, now find it....) in their place, but the back button can always be clicked without dependence. It is possible to make **next** click without dependence or it is Nadav's preference? V

### Milestone 1 - road map

*   Create a new swmd (`@swimm/swmd`) package.

*   Bring in the bare minimum of parsing/serialization, editor component an so on.

*   Bring in the standalone demo app for developing the editor.

    *   Decide on what it should include. Do we want some debug panel in the main app?

*   Tiptap Vue Devtools plugin?

*   Infrastructure for testing.

    *   vitest

    *   Cypress/Playwright component testing?

*   Integrate the new `SwmdEditor` component into the web app as a new page (Without most of the existing functionality of `EditDoc`), under a feature flag in the `.env` that will modify the router.

    *   TODO We might want something that can work at runtime?

*   Handle the interface between `SwmdEditor` and where to parse/serialize the doc, avoiding `v-model` cycles, and so on. (In particular the title component is outside the `SwmdEditor`.)

STP:

test list -

1.  text and paragraph

2.  gap cursor, spaces (Spaces Between lines and paragraphs, Leading and trailling spaces)

3.  TipTap Vue commands: Bold, Italic, Strike, Hading, clear marks, code, bullet list, order list, quote, Redo, Undo

4.  Conversions from a document to SWmd file do not effect the content

5.  Conversions from SWmd file to document do not effect the content

pre-conditions -

*   Testing Environment -

*   dev tools at local host

*   Swimm web app - new Swmd Editor feature flag is on in the `.env`

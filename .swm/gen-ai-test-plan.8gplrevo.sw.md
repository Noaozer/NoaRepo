**Intro**

/generate isn't being used very much. The hypothesis is that not many people see it because not many people use slash commands inside snippets.

**Preconditions**

*   Setting up a testing environment after development is complete

*   Comprehensive testing plan - STP

**Testing Environment**

*   Dev local/Staging

*   variable workspaces

**Testing strateg**

*   Performing a full and comprehensive QA round

*   The bugs will be forwarded to the developer for handling the bugs under the task ticket

*   Second QA round will be performed after the bug fixes, to test the fix and regressions, in order to ensure the quality of the assignment

**Software Test Plan**

Snippets configurations to test

*   Repo snippet

*   Cross-repository snippets

*   Collapsed snippet

*   Swimm port

Functional Tests

1.  Enable gen AI

2.  Add a description with Gen AI to the repo snippet

3.  Add a description with Gen AI to the cross repo snippet

4.  Add a description with Gen AI to collapsed snippet

5.  Type to stop Gen AI

6.  Make sure Swimm port recognizes description

UI changes:

1.  Placeholder in snippet:
*   Snippet's describe : placeholder in snippet to `Use /generate to describe this snippet, or write your own`

*   Show magic write icon to the left of the placeholder - clickable and activate /generate.

*   Once the user starts writing - icon should disappear
<br/>

*   Error messages:

## Milestone 3 - road map

**1 Swimm Object**

*   Path - md syntax + migrating vue component and extension

*   Implement slash commands for basic editing and path

*   Check multi repo

**Hooking auto sync**

*   Running auto sync on new editor (will only receive paths as input at the moment)

## STP

*   **Path**
1.  Add path to folders

2.  Add path to files

3.  Choose a path hub modal - repos list, functionally, Navigate

4.  Place the cursor on path - make sure hover appears

5.  Click on path to files - make sure it opens the right file

6.  Add the same path several times in the document

7.  Add paths next to each other - same line

8.  Delete path

9.  Add cross repo paths
*   **slash commands**
1.  Type slash - commands hub modal open, verify window opening compatibility

2.  Commands hub modal - functionally, navigate, keyboard

3.  Type slash in different areas in the doc

4.  Type slash and write text

5.  Type slash and change screen size
*   **Multi repo**
1.  Cross repo commands - path
*   **Auto sync**
1.  Verify auto sync is running - when commit the doc, open a doc, refresh page

2.  Verify path

3.  Auto syncable path

4.  Outdated path

**SWMD bugs**

**Use cases:**

1.  Using isDirectory in path symbol - We cannot rely on that field to exist in case we need that information in other places. still using this field? do we replace it?

2.  symbol next to each other - without gap (see that nothing breaks and still looks the same)

3.  Performance - While editing documents with a size-able amount of content there is an extremely noticeable amount of lag.

4.  Spaces - check spaces-tabs, new lines do not persist

5.  Import docs - RST docs import automatically (RST - is a file format for textual data used primarily in the Python programming language community for technical documentation)

6.  Editor - new line is added when saving a document between a bullet item and the line after it (reproduce it and check the SWmd)

7.  use case SWMD on PRs - the line numbers changed and thus they see it as changes and it's a noise

8.  Using a standard MD Linter - verify that our schema is adheres to it (Linter is a system that go through mark down syntax and make sure it's fine)

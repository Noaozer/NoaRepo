*   Paste mermaid code outside of mermaid cell from [mermaid.live](http://mermaid.live)

*   In existing mermaid cell, copy and paste some of the content

*   Paste mermaid code inside another extension
<br/>

**SWMD parse/serialize SWM new syntax:**

1.  create a doc with editor commands **Swimm Syntax**\-

2.  (Code) Snippet

3.  (Smart) Token

4.  Doc/Playlist links (AKA Swimm links, just links to another doc).

5.  Mention

6.  commit the doc

7.  go through SWmd:
*   compare the SWmd to the doc - make sure every syntax in SWmd represents command in the doc

*   make sure the file is written in Swimm new syntax (view all symbols)
2.  open the file - make sure Swimm read the file and shows every command right

3.  create a doc with editor commands (Swimm + mark down syntax)

4.  try to break the syntax

5.  commit changes

6.  make sure the doc present all the commands (without break)

7.  go through SWmd:
*   compare the SWmd to the doc - make sure every syntax in SWmd represents command in the doc
